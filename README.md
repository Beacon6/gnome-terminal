## Usage

1. Make sure `dconf` (sometimes called `dconf-cli` or `dconf-editor`) is installed on your system
2. `git clone https://github.com/catppuccin/gnome-terminal`
3. `cd gnome-terminal/` 
4. `./install.sh "Terminal profile name"`
5. You can now remove the directory

The script can be ran without any argumnets: It will list your profiles, if you have any, or create a profile named "Default" and apply the theme to it
